The pie chart illustrate four main causes of worldwide land degraded
as we can see over-grazing is account for 35% which is the major reason of
the worldwide land degraded. anther is deforestation and over-cultivation one is 30% another is 28%.

The table shows the percentage of land degradation by deforestation, over-cultivation and over-grazing in 3 region

The figure of europe is the hightest land degraded in this 3 region which 10% higher than Oceania and 18% higher than North America. In detail, 23% total land degraded in Europe, deforestation account for 9.8%, over-cultivation is 7.7% and over-grazing is 5.5%. follow by Oceania had different pattern with Europe, Over-cultivation in total land degraded is zero, and deforestation is merely 1.7%, but over-grazing is 5% higher than Europe with exactly 11.3%. Compare with North America which the lowest point in three region. 5% total land degraded is make up from 0.2% deforestation, 3.3% over-cultivation and 1.5% over-grazing
