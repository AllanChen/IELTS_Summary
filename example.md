The table shows the rise in the number of visitors to Australia from a 
number of other countries worldwide over the 1990s. Looking at the data 
on the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other countries
in Europe, we can see that the number of visitors to Australia from all these countries
increased significantly over the decade.（开头段改写原题，以及给出全部国家的基本趋势）

The largest number of visitors in total came from United Kingdom, which rose from 258 
thousand in 1991 to 509 thousand in 1999.（人数最多）Visitors from the United States accounted 
for the second largest groups of tourists, the number of which increased from 259 thousand 
to just under 400 thousand over the decade.（人数第二）Furthermore, this period also experienced
 the biggest increase in the proportion of visitors from other countries in Europe, which 
 climbed from 172 thousand in 1991 to almost 400 thousand in 1999.（人数第三）

As regards Germany, exactly 75,000 German travelled to Australia in 1991, but the figure
 almost doubled at the end of the decade, with 140 thousand visiting it.（人数第四）It is 
 interesting to note that there were considerably fewer visitors from Canada than from other 
 places, although the figure rose over the same period from 51,000 to 75,000, with most of 
 the increase occurring in the second half of the decade.（人数最少）

The table indicates that Australia is increasing in popularity as a tourist destination


### Pie char example 
In all three years, the greatest expenditure was on staff salaries.（概括句）
But while other workers' salaries saw a fall from 28% in 1981 to only 15% of spending
in 2001（第二占比）, teachers' pay remained the biggest cost, reaching 50% of total spending
in 1991 and ending at 45% in 2001.（最大占比）

Expenditure on resources such as books had increased
to 20% by 1991 before decreasing to only 9% by the end of the period.
（第三占比）In contrast, the cost of furniture and equipment（第四占比）saw 
an opposite trend. This cost decreased to only 5% of total expenditure in 
1991 but rose dramatically in 2001 when it represented 23% of the school budget.
 Similarly, the cost of insurance saw a rising trend, growing from 
 only 2% to 8% by 2001.（最小占比）


### bar example
The data indicates that the country with a more developed economy has a higher proportion
of workers in the service sector than in the agricultural sector.（概括句，写法不是唯一的）
Speaking of Japan first（引出第一个国家）, approximately six out of ten people work in the service sector,
the figure doubling the percentage of population employed in industry（倍数对比；double这里作动词）. 
However, a mere 5% of working population work in the agricultural sector（mere表示数量少）.

As far as India is concerned, we can see that the majority of the Indian workforce,
amounting to two thirds of its people, is employed in the agricultural sector, 
while the service sector hires less than half the number of that（分数对比）. 
The lowest percentage of employees work in industry, with 10%. When it comes to Brazil,
exactly half of the people find their jobs in the service sector.
Interestingly, an equal number of Brazilians work in the agriculture and industry sectors (25% in each) （相等数据）.

### line bar example
It is clear that the trends of all three networks are upward with the most striking 
feature being the similarity between the National railway network and the London Underground. （概括句）
Starting from one billion passengers using national rail network in 1950（注意1000 百万就是10亿，也就是1 billion，改用简单方便的单位更恰当）, 
this figure rose slightly to a peak of about 1.1 billion just before 1960, before dropping consistently to reach the lowest level of 600 million in 1980.（句型一；连接方式一和二的合并使用）In contrast（表示对比，引出第二条线的描述）, the number of people who used the London Underground in the 1950s was only two thirds of those taking national rail network, with about 750 million. After this（连接方式六）, this number remained stable for the next 20 years, followed by（连接方式四）a gradual decrease to a low of 500 million in around 1985. However（连接方式三）, the next several years experienced a rapid increase in passenger numbers of London underground（句型三）, to equal those using national rail network（equal这里作及物动词，表示“与...相等”）. Thereafter（连接方式六）, both followed a very similar pattern as they showed an upward trend towards the billion passenger mark until 2004/05（句型五）, with the 1980s and the early 2000s seeing the sharpest increase（句型三）.

On the other hand（“另一方面”，引出第三条线的描述）, after their introduction in the 1960s（连接方式二）, the light railway and metro systems carried fewer passengers than the other two networks, no more than around ten million over the first 15 years. Nonetheless（连接方式三）, in the 1980, there was a marginal increase in the number of journeys made by passengers（句型二）, reaching nearly 200 million in 2004/05.
